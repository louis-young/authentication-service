![Login](documentation/login.jpg)

## Description

This is an application which serves as an authentication boilerplate using built React, Node/Express and MongoDB.

## Motivation

I built this application to learn about authentication and security, and to provide a boilerplate to use for future projects. I now know about better alternatives to JSON Web Tokens.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Starts the Node/Express server and REST API.
